Data Analysis Project with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a basic data analysis workflow using Python libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for loading the Iris dataset

The tasks cover:

Loading & exploring a dataset

Performing basic data analysis

Creating different types of visualizations

Dataset used: Iris dataset (from sklearn.datasets).

🚀 Tasks
Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

Load dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

Inspect first few rows with .head()

Check data types and missing values (.info(), .isnull())

Clean dataset by handling missing values

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

Compute statistical summary (.describe())

Perform grouping by categorical column (species)

Find average petal length per species

Identify interesting patterns (Virginica has the longest petals)

Task 3: Data Visualization

Created 4 visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn:

📈 Line Chart – Trend of sepal length across samples

📊 Bar Chart – Average petal length per species

📉 Histogram – Distribution of sepal width

🔵 Scatter Plot – Sepal length vs. petal length, colored by species

Each plot is customized with titles, labels, and legends.

🛠️ Installation & Setup

Clone this repository or download the script.

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Run the script:

python analysis.py

📌 Example Insights

The Iris Virginica species has the longest petals on average.

Sepal width distribution shows most flowers fall between 2.5–3.5 cm.

Sepal length and petal length are positively correlated across species.

✅ This project is a starting point for data exploration and visualization.
You can extend it with:

New datasets (sales, weather, finance, etc.)

More advanced visualizations (heatmaps, pair plots)

Machine learning (classification with Iris dataset)
